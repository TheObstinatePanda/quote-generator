Project Title: quote-generator.js
=====

Description 
---
This project is part of the CodeCademy curriculum. I chose to make it a back and forth conversation where one person is telling terrible panda based puns

Features
---
 Four lines of dialogue will be randomly put together to create a unique conversation each time the program is run. Each line is delayed by 1000 ms to give a somewhat natural 'chat room' style to the messages.

How to Use
---
 This is designed to be run with node, I am still learning how to incorporate script into HTML files/webdevelopment. As I learn that I may apply this in a webpage.

Technologies: JavaScript - developed using *VisualStudio*
